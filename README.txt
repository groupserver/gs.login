Introduction
============

This product is responsible to showing the Login page for a GroupServer
site. The page can be shown in two ways:

#. The user explicitly visits ``login.html`` or
#. A Permission Denied error is  generated.

In the latter case a login page is shown if the anonymous-user generated
the error, otherwise a Permission Denied error is shown. The error
has a link to the support email for the site, so the user can easily
contact support if he or she thinks she saw the error in error.
