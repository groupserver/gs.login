      <h1>Password Sent</h1>

      <p>
        A new password has just been sent to the 
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        provided 
        (<span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('providedInfo', '')"/>).
        When you receive the new password, please 
        <a href="/login.html">log in</a>.</p>
      
      <p>
        If you do not receive an email message, the
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        may be incorrect.
        Please check the 
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        and
        <a href="/forgottenpassword.html">return to the password reset page</a> and
        enter the correct
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>.

      <h2 id="privacyNote">Privacy Note</h2>

      <p>We at OnlineGroups.Net take
        <a
          href="http://onlinegroups.net/onlinegroups/policies/privacy/"
          title="OnlineGroups.Net Privacy Policy">privacy</a>
        seriously, which is why the above statement does not say if
        the 
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        you provided matched a user of OnlineGroups.Net.
        (If the 
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        did not match a user of OnlineGroups.Net, then no password
        would be reset and no message sent.)
        The system <emph>does</emph> know if the 
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        that you provided matched a registered user.
        However, if you were told that a match was found, then the
        password reset feature could be used, by a nefarious
        individual or organisation, to find out if someone does or
        does not belong to an OnlineGroups.Net site &#8212; which
        would be a violation of the person's privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, by protecting the privacy of our users, we have
        made the password reset feature harder to use: it is quite
        easy to mistype the
        <span 
          tal:content="python:request.get('user_or_address', '')"/>
        and it can take quite some time before you realise that your
        password has not been reset, as you are looking for the 
        <emph>absence</emph> of an email message.
        However, we at OnlineGroups.Net feel that, in
        this case, your privacy was more valuable than usability.
        We hope you understand.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With luck, now you have read this, the email containing your
        new password has had time to arrive&#8230;
